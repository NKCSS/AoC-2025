# Nick Kusters Advent of Code 2025 code in C#

It's that time of the year again! Advent of Code 2025 is uppon us.

I streamed the last few years and had a lot of fun. Like last year, I won't be able to keep any kind of schedule, so I'll stream when I can and probably won't be editing the videos; I hope you can understand 😊
